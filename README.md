# Valve Proton Binaries
What's This?
------------
In this repository are unofficial binary builds of Proton; made using Github Actions and Docker.

Proton is a compatibility layer that lets Linux users play Windows games. If you use the Steam client then you already have Proton. I don't use the Steam client.

See [here](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) for details.
